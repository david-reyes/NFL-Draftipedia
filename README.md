# NFL-Draftipedia

NFL Draftipedia is a reference app that lists historical drafts by team and by year, with a player bio section for each player. It also has a search capability.

It was originally intended for publication in the Apple App Store, but was ultimately rejected because Apple no longer accepts reference apps, they said.
